## Can I customize the Prism UI Pack ?

Yes, Prism UI Pack is fully customizable through convars. You can set themes, colors, and options directly in your `server.cfg` before starting the resource.

## Do I need to change my existing code to use Prism UI Pack ?

No, you don’t. Prism UI Pack is designed as a drop-in replacement. You can migrate from `ox_lib` UI components to Prism_UI with zero code changes required.

## Is Prism UI Pack compatible with `ox_lib` ?

Yes. Prism UI Pack includes a compatibility script—just add `@prism_uipack/init.lua` to the `shared_scripts` section of your `fxmanifest.lua`.

## Can I translate the UI ?

Yes, Prism UI Pack supports multiple languages. Set your preferred locale through convars and Prism_UI will load the matching translation.

## Does my version of `ox_lib` matter ?

No. Prism UI Pack is a complete redesign compatible with any version of `ox_lib`. There are no version restrictions.

## Can I run Prism UI Pack with other resources ?

Yes. Prism UI Pack is lightweight and designed to work alongside other resources, provided they don’t overwrite the same UI components.
