<Callout type="info">
  Why use a CDN? It provides players with a smoother experience on your server by eliminating the need to download all clothing images during login. Instead, the images are pre-downloaded through the CDN, allowing players to load in and create their character without any delays.

  Make sure you’ve completed all the steps for generating the images. If not, refer to the page that explains the process.

    ### Step 3

    Navigate to the `illenium-appearance\web\dist\clothing` folder, select all the clothing images, and begin uploading them.

    ### Step 4

    Once all clothing images have been successfully uploaded, click on any image and copy its ID.

    <Image src='/fminfo2.avif' alt='cdnstep4' width={1920} height={384} />

    ### Step 5

    Open the `illenium-appearance\shared\config.lua` file, enable the CDN option, and paste the ID.

    
    <Image src='/fminfo3.avif' alt='cdnstep4' width={1920} height={384} />

    ### Step 6

    Go to `illenium-appearance\web\dist\clothing`, delete all the images in the folder, restart your server, and enjoy.
