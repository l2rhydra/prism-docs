- yarn ( comes with fivem by default )

<Steps>

### Step 1

Simply place the resource in your resources folder
Do not use a subfolder like `resources/[scripts]` as it will cause the script to malfunction.

### Step 2

Open your `server.cfg`, make sure it has `ensure fivem-greenscreener`, then restart your server and load in.

### Step 3

Once all photos have been successfully taken, navigate to `fivem-greenscreener/images/clothing` and copy all the images in that folder. Then go to `illenium-appearance/web/dist/clothing` and paste the images there.

### Step 4

Restart your server and load in!
