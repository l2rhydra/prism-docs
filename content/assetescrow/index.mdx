# Common Issues & Solutions

### Below are the most common errors encountered when using the FiveM Escrow System, along with their solutions :

<Steps>

### ❌ Failed to verify protected resource ``resource-name``

If you encounter this error, it usually means that files were corrupted during the transfer process. FTP programs, such as FileZilla, might sometimes skip important encrypted files like `.fxap`.
    <SolutionBox>
      <ul>
        -   <li>Ensure that all encrypted files are properly copied, including the ``.fxap`` file</li>
            <li>If you're using FileZilla, try switching to WinSCP for file transfers to avoid skipped files.</li>
      </ul>
    </SolutionBox>
 
### ⚠️ You lack the required entitlement to use ``resource-name``

This error means that your FiveM server license key is not linked to the correct account where the asset was purchased. It could also happen if you haven’t restarted your server after installing the asset.

    <SolutionBox>
      <ul>
        - <li>Verify the server license key is linked to the account where the asset was purchased.</li>
        <li>Restart your server after installing the asset to ensure proper loading.</li>
      </ul>
    </SolutionBox>

### ⚙️ Syntax error ``</1>`` or similar

This error can be caused by several issues:

> - You might be using an outdated FiveM artifact version (lower than 4960).
> - Editing encrypted code is not allowed and may cause this error.
> - The server may not have been restarted after installation.

    <SolutionBox>
      <ul>
        - <li>Ensure you are using artifact version ``4960 or higher``. Download the latest artifacts from [here](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/).</li>
        <li>Make sure ``encrypted code has not been edited``.</li>
        <li>``Restart your server`` after installation to ensure everything works correctly.</li>
      </ul>
    </SolutionBox>

</Steps>
