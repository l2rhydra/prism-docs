>Frequently asked questions about prism-emotemenu</div>

## General Questions

### How do I open the emote menu?
Check your keybind settings in the configuration file. The default keybind is typically set in `shared/config.lua`.

### Can I customize the emote menu UI?
Yes, the UI is fully customizable. You can modify the styling in the `web/src` directory, specifically in the component files and the `index.scss` file.

## Custom Emotes

### How do I record custom emotes?
First, make sure you have `prism_mediatool` installed from your keymaster account (includes `ts-recorder` and `ts-medialib`). Then add your custom emote entry to `client/AnimationList.lua`. Finally, use the `/recordemotes` command in-game. The system will automatically record your animations based on the AnimationList.lua entries and save them to `ts-recorder/recordings/processed`.

### Where do I put custom animation files?
After recording with `/recordemotes`, copy all recorded animation files from `ts-recorder/recordings/processed` and paste them into `prism-emoteassets/animations` folder. The emote entries should already be in `client/AnimationList.lua` from before you recorded them.

### My custom emotes aren't showing up
<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure you have:
  1. Installed `prism_mediatool` from your keymaster (includes `ts-recorder` and `ts-medialib`)
  2. Added the emote entries to `client/AnimationList.lua` BEFORE recording
  3. Used `/recordemotes` command to record the animations
  4. Copied the files from `ts-recorder/recordings/processed` to `prism-emoteassets/animations`
  5. Restarted the resource after adding new emotes
  6. Verified that `prism-emoteassets` is properly installed

## Troubleshooting

### The emote menu won't open
- Verify the resource is running: use `restart prism-emotemenu` in server console
- Check for any errors in the F8 console
- Ensure no conflicting resources are interfering with the keybind

### Drag and drop functionality not working
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl + F5)
- Ensure you have the latest version of the resource
- Check the F8 console for any JavaScript errors

### Animations not playing correctly
- Verify the animation files are in the correct format
- Ensure `prism-emoteassets` is loaded before `prism-emotemenu`
- Check that the animation dictionaries are properly loaded

## Performance

### Is the emote menu optimized?
Yes, the emote menu uses modern React with virtualized scrolling for optimal performance, even with hundreds of emotes.

### Does it support custom fonts?
Yes, custom fonts can be added to the `web/public/fonts/` directory and referenced in your CSS.
