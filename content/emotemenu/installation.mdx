## Recording Custom Emotes

<Callout type="info">
  The emote menu includes built-in functionality to record custom emotes directly in-game. You'll need `prism_mediatool` from your keymaster account which includes `ts-recorder` and `ts-medialib`.
</Callout>

### Prerequisites

Download `prism_mediatool` from your [cfx portal](https://portal.cfx.re/) which includes:
- `ts-recorder` - For recording animations
- `ts-medialib` - Media library dependency

Ensure both resources are installed and running before attempting to record custom emotes.

### How to Record

1. Open `client/AnimationList.lua` and add your custom emote entry first
2. Use the command `/recordemotes` in-game
3. The system will automatically record your animations based on the entries in AnimationList.lua
4. Recordings are automatically saved to `ts-recorder/recordings/processed`

### Adding Custom Emotes to Menu

1. Navigate to `ts-recorder/recordings/processed` folder
2. Copy all recorded animation files
3. Paste them into `prism-emoteassets/animations` folder
4. Restart the resource to load the new emotes

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure you have `prism_mediatool` (which includes `ts-recorder` and `ts-medialib`) and `prism-emoteassets` installed for custom emote recording to work properly.
